            <h2>User Research</h2>
            <p>
                To help guide our design process our team observed users in a controlled environment to collect
                qualitative data on how UVic students interact with the current UVic web services, in particular, MyPage
                and Student Services. After some brief background questions we asked the students to perform a number of
                common tasks using the UVic web services.

        <div class="col-md-8 col-md-offset-2">
            <h2>Our Personas and Scenarios</h2>
            <p>We developed two personas to help guide our design. The two personas we chose were a junior
                student, Daniel, who had just started at UVic and a senior student, Amy, who was in her third
                year.</p>

        <div class="col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
            <img class="img-circle img-responsive" src="assets/img/daniel.jpg" alt="Daniel" width="200">
            <h3>
                Daniel LÃ©vesque
                <br/>
                <small>Junior Student</small>
            </h3>
            <p>Daniel is a smart, caring, but cautious man from Houston, Texas. He caries forth his southern hospitality
                to everyone he meets, making him an easy man to get along with. In high school he was involved with the
                students' council, took info tech courses, and spent most of his time doing woodwork.</p>

            </h3>
            <p>Amy is an artistic 23 year old girl from Fredricton, New Brunswick. After graduating from high school she
                spent a year travelling. She fell in love with the many stories of people she met. Inspired by this, Amy
                set out to capture her perspective and tell stories through film. </p>

            <h2>Ideation and Whiteboarding</h2>
            <p>To brainstorm, our team projected the existing UVic mypage onto the whiteboard to throw around ideas of
                how to organize the existing content</p>
            <img src="assets/img/improvements.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            <p>Singling out each feature, we decided how to categorize and lay them out</p>
            <img src="assets/img/planning.jpg" class="img-responsive">
            <p>Once the features were listed, we layed them out in categories to work into our low fidelity prototype</p>

            <h2>Low Fidelity Iterations</h2>
            <p>Using our plan previously developed, we layed out the elements in their respective pages</p>
            <img src="assets/img/Finances-Balances.png" class="img-responsive">
            <p>As we implemented features in Balsamiq and the pages came together, naturally we moved elements around to
                places we deemed appropriate</p>
            <img src="assets/img/Home-Expanded-Event.png" class="img-responsive">
            <p>When we ran into usability issues or found a better solution, we revisited the drawing board to
                brainstorm new solutions</p>
            <img src="assets/img/Home-Building-Page.png" class="img-responsive">
            <p>Upon discovering a better way, we implemented it and re-tested, thereby iterating towards the 'best'
                solution</p>

            <h2>Building the Prototype</h2>
            <p>We decided that to provide the most realistic prototype while still allowing flexibility, it would be best
                build a static website.</p>
            <p>To do this, we used Handlebars and Grunt to generate static HTML pages from templates we built and JSON
                to populate data fields</p>
